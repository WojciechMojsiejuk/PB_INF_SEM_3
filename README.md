Programs written for BUT classes purpose only [year 1.0:3]

While uploading your files please keep this pattern:

1. Choose correct project (If there is no project to which your files could belong create new project or put it in default project called "Other"

2. Choose correct category:

        To do - for every file which needs to be done 
        
        In progress - for files on which you currently working (You can set different labels such as 'help wanted' if you'd like someone to help you with this program or 'bug' if your program doesn't work)
        
        Done - if you think your file is working correctly. 

3. To merge pull request file should be reviewed by AT LEAST one person

4. file pattern [#List][Task]{brief description}


Example:

    (Project: Podstawy programowania)(Category:Done)(List#3)[List#3][Zadanie5]tablica.c{Program obliczajacy sume na przekatnych w tablicy}

Trivia:

    ()-you don't have to write it, it's just a visualization of steps 1 and 2;

    []-This is how your branch should look like. I still don't know how recognition system in GIT works, please use this pattern; might be changed in the future

    tablica.c - file name

     {} description should be put in first commit when creating a file

5.KISS (Keep it simple stupid)

6. Commit should focus on one single project (it can consists many files if they are somewhat connected)
PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT MANY FILES NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHERS (Different tasks, lists etc.)
